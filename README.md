ra-tools
========
ra-tools is a set of tools to help streamline basic hospital merger analysis, providing functions for the following standard analyses:

	* geographic market tables (patient origin tables)
	* market share (HHI) tables
	* service comparison tables
	* distance matricies
	
In addition to these functions, ra-tools provides functions for creating project and subproject directories, allowing collaborators to spend less time standardizing their project directory structure and more time digging into the data.
